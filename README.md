# Inappropriate-text-detection-and-rephrasing-using-NLP
A NLP classification model to detect inappropriate text and rephase the sentence after removing them.

# Abstract
With the expansion of the communication platforms, individuals are very used to exchange information and communicate with other people through these platforms, both for social and business purposes. It’s a known problem, that many people use the anonymity provided by these platforms to use inappropriate and offensive language. Using, cloud we want to deploy such machine learning models and make sure that the communication does not contain any such inappropriate words. We will be using different clustering methods and as we are also taking human language as input we have to use NLP (Natural Language Programming) then if possible we will be also be integrating these models with deep learning models for more accurate predictions. In the cloud side we will be requiring a web server to host our chat application and also ML code runner as we want to run the code in the cloud side. So, we will be requiring a ML code runner which can run on the cloud side like AWS Sagemaker which provide us with notebook instance where we deploy our ML code easily.
